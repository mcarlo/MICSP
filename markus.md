Fuel Efficiency vs Transmission Type: Quantifying the Effect of Automatic vs Manual Transmission on Miles Per Gallon (MPG) Fuel Efficiency
========================================
# 1.0 Synopsis
This analysis addresses whether an automatic or manual transmission is better for MPG. It attempts to quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

This analysis finds:

* Automatic transmissions are more fuel efficient than manual transmissions

* Controlling for other variables, in the sample data automatic transmission added 4.07 MPG

# 2.0 Data Processing
The data consists of 32 observations from the mtcars data within the R package datasets. The mtcars documentation states the data \"was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).\"
