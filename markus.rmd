Fuel Efficiency vs Transmission Type: Quantifying the Effect of Automatic vs Manual Transmission on Miles Per Gallon (MPG) Fuel Efficiency
========================================
# 1.0 Synopsis
This analysis addresses whether an automatic or manual transmission is better for MPG. It attempts to quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

This analysis finds:

* Automatic transmissions are more fuel efficient than manual transmissions

* Controlling for other variables, in the sample data automatic transmission added 4.07 MPG

# 2.0 Data Processing
The data consists of 32 observations from the mtcars data within the R package datasets. The mtcars documentation states the data \"was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).\"

## 2.1 Tabulate count, fatalities, and injuries by category
Now we can tabulate by event type the number of instances involving casualties, the sum of fatalities by event type, and the sum of injuries by category.

# 3.0 Results

## 3.1 Tornado is the weather category most harmful to population health. 
Figure 1 below displays the most harmful weather event categories, fatalities vs. injuries, conditional on either injuries or fatalities reported. The size of the bubbles indicate the total count of such events in that category resulting either in fatalities or injuries. 

I plot the data on log10 scales to accommodate such wide ranges of results.
