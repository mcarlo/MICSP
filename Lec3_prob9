# This script applies the bisection method to guess a user's number between
# 0 and 100. The output should read like so:
#


low = 0
high = 100
answer = 50
guess = False
reply = 'h'
print('Please think of a number between ' + str(low) + ' and ' + str(100) + '!')
while guess == False:
    print('Is your secret number ' + str(answer)' + '?')
    print("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. "),
    print("Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. "),
    reply = raw_input("Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. ")
    if reply not in ('c', 'h', 'l'):
        print("Sorry, I didn't understand your answer.")
    elif reply = 'c':
        guess = True
    elif reply = 'h':
        high = answer
        answer = (high + low)/2
    elif reply = 'l':
        low = answer
        answer = (high + low)/2

print("Game over. Your secret number was: " + str(answer))
